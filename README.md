# @ngrok/nextjs

Run `next dev` with a public ngrok URL, in one command.
```
npx @ngrok/nextjs dev
```

Built on [`@ngrok/ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngrok/ngrok), ngrok's official
JavaScript SDK — a native module, and nothing to install besides this package.

## Setup

1. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and grab an authtoken from
   [the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/authtokens).
2. Put it in `.env.local` in your Next.js project root:
   ```
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```
   npx @ngrok/nextjs dev
   ```

You'll get a public URL bound to your ngrok account's dev domain.

## What it does

- Spawns `next dev` and opens an ngrok tunnel to it as one process, so stopping it
  (`Ctrl+C`) cleanly tears down both — including `next dev`'s own child processes.
- Defaults to your account's dev domain (`abc123.ngrok-free.dev`).
- Syncs the tunnel URL into `.env.local` under `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` by
  default, so auth libraries and client code pick it up automatically.
- Prints a QR code so you can open the tunnel on your phone. Disable with `NGROK_QR=false`.
- Prints a one-time setup checklist on first run per project, reminding you to register the
  URL with your OAuth/webhook providers.

## Config

Optional `ngrok.config.ts` (or `.js`/`.mjs`) in your project root. 

```ts
export default {
  url: "https://your-reserved-domain.ngrok.app", // omit for the account's default dev domain
  env: { url: ["NEXTAUTH_URL", "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL"] },
  trafficPolicy: `
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: basic-auth
        config:
          credentials:
            - "user:password123"
`,
};
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | `string?` | Public endpoint URL, with scheme. |
| `pooling` | `boolean?` | Opt in to ngrok endpoint pooling so multiple endpoints can intentionally share one `url` with load-balanced routing. Required when two endpoints would otherwise collide on the same URL. |
| `trafficPolicy` | `string?` | A raw [ngrok Traffic Policy](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/) document (YAML or JSON) — the mechanism for auth, IP restrictions, header manipulation, webhook verification, and more. |
| `env.url` | `string[]?` | Which env vars in `.env.local` get this endpoint's URL. |
| `binding` | `"public" \| "internal" \| "kubernetes"?` | Ingress configuration. |
| `endpoints` | `EndpointConfig[]?` | multi-endpoint case — front more than one local service from a single command. Supersedes the root-level fields above entirely. Each entry also takes `upstream` (a port number or raw address string) alongside `url`/`pooling`/`trafficPolicy`/`env`/`binding`. |

### Personal overrides

Two ways to override the shared config without editing a committed file:

- `NGROK_DOMAIN` env var (bare domain or full URL)
- `ngrok.config.local.ts` — same shape as `ngrok.config.ts`, gitignore it

Resolution order: `NGROK_DOMAIN` → `ngrok.config.local.ts` → `ngrok.config.ts` → account
default dev domain.

### Multiple endpoints

```ts
export default {
  endpoints: [
    { upstream: 3000, url: "https://app.mycompany.ngrok.app" },
    { upstream: 4000, url: "https://api.mycompany.ngrok.app" },
  ],
};
```

Each endpoint needs its own distinct `url`, or `pooling: true` on every endpoint sharing one.

## Examples

### Use your own domain instead of the default dev domain

Requires a domain reserved on your ngrok account. Three ways to point at it, in order of precedence:

**Env var** — quickest, no file needed:
```
NGROK_DOMAIN=myapp.ngrok.app npx @ngrok/nextjs dev
```
Or put it in `.env.local`. Accepts a bare domain (auto-prefixed to `https://`) or a full URL.

**`ngrok.config.local.ts`** — gitignored, personal-only, persists across runs without
re-exporting an env var every time:
```ts
export default {
  url: "https://myapp.ngrok.app",
};
```

**`ngrok.config.ts`** — committed, shared with the team. Only makes sense here if the domain
is meant for whoever's running the tool at the time, not concurrently by multiple people — see
[Personal overrides](#personal-overrides) for why.
```ts
export default {
  url: "https://myapp.ngrok.app",
};
```

### Traffic Policy examples

`trafficPolicy` is a raw [ngrok Traffic Policy](https://ngrok.com/docs/traffic-policy/)
document (YAML or JSON) in `ngrok.config.ts`, applied to the endpoint as-is. A few common ones:

**Basic auth**:
```ts
export default {
  trafficPolicy: `
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: basic-auth
        config:
          credentials:
            - "user:password123"
`,
};
```

**IP allowlist**:
```ts
export default {
  trafficPolicy: `
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: restrict-ips
        config:
          enforce: true
          allow:
            - "203.0.113.0/24"
`,
};
```

**Webhook signature verification**:
```ts
export default {
  trafficPolicy: `
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: verify-webhook
        config:
          provider: stripe
          secret: "whsec_..."
`,
};
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- An ngrok account and authtoken.

## Development

```
pnpm install
pnpm run build   # compiles src/ -> dist/
pnpm test         # runs the unit test suite
```

See [`examples/test-app`](examples/test-app) for a working Next.js app to test against, and
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for the design rationale and everything confirmed empirically along
the way.
